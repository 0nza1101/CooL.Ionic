 This repository was made in order to get many directives and components style to work with to make life easier.
 You will find many many different components, pages, pipes, services, of which can be very useful to you. Note though that these are all experimental!

 The content here is taken from tutorials, github repo and codepen and also other stuff made by the contributors of this project.

 Feel free to contribute so we can have even more content.

 ## Demo
 If you just want to check this project out, you can see the online demo at XXXXXXXXX or use [Ionic View](http://view.ionic.io/) with the code **XXX**.

 Please note that some directives, components are only working on real devices but you can still enable some of them by using **Chrome DevTools device mode**.
 _I will try to not make use of native plugins that only work on real device to keep it focused on directives, components and pipes in a first place._
